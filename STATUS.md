# Status — f(5) and f(6) campaigns (2026-08-05, ~21:00 push)

## Where things stand

| item | state |
|---|---|
| f(5) lower bound | **16**, verified in integer arithmetic (half-cube / Clebsch) |
| f(5) level 20 | **complete**: all 8 graphs certified non-realizable |
| f(5) level 19 | **complete**: all 340 certified |
| f(5) level 18 | **complete**: all 8825 certified  => **f(5) <= 17 proven** |
| f(5) level 17 | **12615 / 12654 certified**; the last 39 are "channel" graphs (see below) — now fully understood and expected to fall quickly on the next run |
| d=5 controls suite | **PASS** (K_7 killed 1 node; K_6 survives; apex+cross killed 2 nodes; cross-polytope survive control isolates the true realizations in 6/24 slices, kills the other 18; K_7-minus-edge survives 24/24) |
| numerics | all 12654 level-17 graphs swept: zero realizable candidates (min residual 0.409 vs 1e-30 for realizable controls); contracted (single-coincidence) systems of the hardest graph also admit no solutions (best 1.03) |
| d=6 level 19 | candidate list complete+verified: **3,971,787** graphs (matches BPSSV); pass 1 complete: **3,055,474 certified** (77%) in 1.4 h; 916,313 deferred to pass 2 (was running when the pythons were killed; fully resumable from killed_d6_n19.log) |
| d=6 controls | K_8 killed, K_7 survives (full suite pending) |
| BPSSV erratum | **confirmed** (see erratum_bpssv_table3_d6.md): Table 3 d=6 column wrong for n>=11 (103333 -> 103194 at n=11, brute-force verified; 1217849 -> 1210392 at n=12; 19170728 -> 18682440 at n=13); their Table 2 and theorems unaffected |

## The 39 channel graphs — solved diagnosis

Symptom: each of the 39 has, per decomposition, 1-3 narrow arcs of the
circle parameter where searches blow past node caps; every decomposition
of every seed clique shows such arcs (34 parametrizations scanned for
graph 11402 — none clean), so the d=4-style "alternate decomposition"
cure does not apply.

Diagnosis (from direct probes): the arcs are NOT geometric channels at
all. Splitting a hot arc once in 8 makes ALL EIGHT sub-arcs die at ~65
nodes each — the full-width interval evaluation of those particular
slices is catastrophically loose (interval dependency blow-up at that
width), nothing more. The previous finisher run certified nothing in an
hour only because its kill-tasks sat behind ~15,000 queued coarse-scan
tasks in the pool FIFO; it was killed just before the payoff.

Next run (queued): tile each remaining graph's circle directly at 768
slices with small caps (skip the coarse scan; sub-slices die at ~65
nodes), tiny escalation ladder for stragglers. Expected: minutes per
graph, all 39 within the hour => f(5) = 16.

## Reproduction pointers

- f(5) levels: `python reproduce5.py --level 20/19/18 [--bulk]`;
  level 17: `--bulk` then `finish17.py` for the tail.
- Controls: `python reproduce5.py --controls` (record in
  controls5_results.txt).
- d=6: `filter_mtf6.c` over `triangleramsey 19` output (list verified,
  3,971,787); campaign driver `reproduce6.py --bulk`; certified indices
  accumulate in `killed_d6_n19.log` (snapshot pushed as .gz).
- Erratum evidence: `enumaeq6.c`, `filter_bin6.c`, `verify_k1333.py`.
